# crowdsale_smart_contract
A project to create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and a crowdsale smart contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

### Some important factors to consider when developing a crowdsale include:

* Price and rate configuration of tokens.
* Whether tokens will be offered at a fixed price.
* Whether to cap, or limit, the total number of tokens released.
* Whether to cap the total number of tokens a single individual can buy.
* How to send tokens to crowdsale investors.
* Timeframe—i.e., when the crowdsale will start and when it will end.
* Whether the funds raised by selling tokens will be distributed during the crowdsale or after it.
* Whether there will be a refund policy if the project’s ultimate goal is not successfully reached.

### Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

### Test the functionality of the crowdsale by using test accounts to buy new tokens and then checking the balances associated with those accounts.

### After purchasing tokens with one or more test accounts, view the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei that has been raised in the crowdsale contract.
